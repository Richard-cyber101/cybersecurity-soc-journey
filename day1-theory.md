# Day 1 â€“ IDS Theory and Suricata Basics

## What I Learned:
- IDS/IPS are used to monitor and detect suspicious activity
- Suricata is a powerful open-source NIDS
- It uses rule-based detection and outputs logs in JSON format
- Key use cases in a SOC include attack detection, traffic inspection, and incident correlation

## How It Ties to Hands-On:
- Installing Suricata
- Will test detection with port scanning (Nmap)
- Will log and analyze alerts

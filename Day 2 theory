# Day 2 â€“ Deep Dive into IDS & Suricata Architecture

## ðŸ§  What I Learned:

### ðŸ”¹ What is an IDS?
- IDS = Intrusion Detection System
- Monitors systems/networks for malicious behavior or violations
- Types:
  - **NIDS (Network-based IDS):** e.g., Suricata, Snort
  - **HIDS (Host-based IDS):** e.g., Auditd

### ðŸ”¹ How Suricata Works:
- Captures packets (AF_PACKET / libpcap)
- Inspects traffic at multiple layers (L2â€“L7)
- Matches traffic against detection rules
- Logs structured alerts in `eve.json`

### ðŸ”¹ Suricata Rule Breakdown:
```text
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"HTTP traffic detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
